Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.



BDD

Take input speed from the user
If speed is less than 70, print ok, else award 2 demerit points for every 5km/s above the speed limit of 70
If demerit points gets more than 2 points print License suspended







PSEUDOCODE

- PRompt user for the speed

- Define the function responsible for the task

- Determine if speed is greater that 70. 

- If speed is less than 70, print ok, else award 2 demerit points for every 5km/s above the speed limit of 70

- If demerit points gets more than 2 points print License suspended
